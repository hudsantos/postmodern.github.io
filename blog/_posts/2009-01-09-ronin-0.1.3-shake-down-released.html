<p>After many bug-fixes and testing Ronin 0.1.3, codenamed "shake down", has finally been released. I split out Ronin::Context into the <a href="http://contextify.rubyforge.org/">Contextify</a> library. Contextify is very handy for frameworks that want to load objects from Ruby files (without using YAML or defining specially named Classes/Modules). I've also refactored <a href="http://reverserequire.rubyforge.org/">reverse-require</a>, integrating it closer with RubyGems 1.3.0. Again, reverse-require is useful for frameworks that want to have a plugin system, but don't want to mess with the archaic gem_plugin. I eventually hope to get some of the code from reverse-requires merged into RubyGems. The <kbd>Ronin::Objectify</kbd> and <a href="http://ronin.rubyforge.org/docs/ronin/Ronin/UI/CommandLine.html">Ronin::UI::CommandLine</a> modules also got a fresh refactoring.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/postmodern/ronin-sql/">ronin-sql</a> also received some refactoring love. It's SQL/Injection DSL was rewritten to uses a token emitter / formatter strategy for generating SQL syntax from the DSL. The use of tokens greatly simplified generating complex syntax from an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; require 'ronin/sql'
=&gt; true
&gt;&gt; puts Code.sql_injection { has_table?(:users) }
AND (SELECT count(*) FROM users) = 1
=&gt; nil
</code></pre>

<p>Not only were there updates, but also some libraries released for the very first time. After sitting on github for a while, <a href="http://github.com/postmodern/ronin-exploits/">ronin-exploits</a> and <a href="http://github.com/postmodern/ronin-scanners/">ronin-scanners</a> were finally released.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://github.com/postmodern/ronin-exploits/">ronin-exploits</a> library provides the ability to define exploits and payloads, as well as caching them in Ronin's database. Since ronin-exploits uses Contextify, writing exploits becomes easy and elegant:</p>

<pre><code># test_exploit.rb
require 'ronin/sessions/tcp'

ronin_exploit do

  extend Sessions::TCP

  self.name = 'test'
  self.version = '0.2'
  self.license = License.cc_by_nc

  self.author(:name =&gt; 'postmodern', :organization =&gt; 'SophSec')

  def builder
    @buffer = 'some data'
  end

  def deployer
    tcp_send(@buffer)
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>The library also allows one to associate Vulnerability Taxonomy information with Exploits or Payloads.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://github.com/postmodern/ronin-scanners/">ronin-scanners</a> library provides interfaces to various security scanners. Currently, ronin-scanners provides a <a href="http://ronin.rubyforge.org/docs/ronin-scanners/Ronin/Scanners/Nmap.html">Rubyful interface</a> to the <a href="http://nmap.org/">Nmap</a> network scanner and <a href="http://ronin.rubyforge.org/docs/ronin-scanners/Ronin/Scanners/NmapTask.html">all of it's options</a>.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; require 'ronin/scanners'
=&gt; true
&gt;&gt; puts Scanners::Nmap.scan(:targets =&gt; 'www.google.com', :ports =&gt; [80,21,25], :service_scan =&gt; true)

=&gt; nil
</code></pre>

<p>The library also uses <a href="http://scandb.rubyforge.org/">ScanDB</a>, so that Nmap scan results can be stored or queried using ScanDB's database.</p>

<p>Now that I've completed another round of refactoring and releasing updated libraries, I can focus on other things, such as improving Ronin's <a href="http://ronin.rubyforge.org">website</a> and build a presentation for Ronin. Recently I was invited by evoltech from <a href="http://hackbloc.org">HackBloc</a> to trek down to the Bay Area and give a mini-presentation on Ronin at this years <a href="http://hackmeet.org/">Hack Meet</a>. Hack Meet is a semi-regular non-corporate hacker meet-up / mini-conference, where hackers gather and share their latest projects.</p>
