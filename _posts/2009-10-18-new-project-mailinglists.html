<p>As I've begun to get increasing amounts of email from other developers and users, I've wondered whether it's time to setup some mailing-lists.</p>

<p>Well, thanks to the efforts of Franck D'agostini, <a href="http://spidr.rubyforge.org/">Spidr</a> now has a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/spidr">mailing-list</a>. I hope this mailing-list will help foster interesting discussions between users/developers and possible improvements to Spidr.</p>

<p>I also took the liberty of setting up an IRC channel for Spidr, since IRC is still a mainstay of developers (although I like <a href="http://xmpp.org/about/">XMPP</a> a little more). Just join <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#spidr">#spidr</a> on <a href="http://freenode.net/">irc.freenode.net</a>.</p>

<p>Seeing the potential for how mailing-lists can help a project, I also setup a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ronin-ruby">Google Group</a> for <a href="http://ronin.rubyforge.org/">Ronin</a>. <b>Obvious Privacy Warning:</b> Since Google indexes pretty much everything, sketchy discussions relating to Ronin should probably happen somewhere beyond Google's reach, for one's own security and privacy.</p>

<p>So yeah, let's see what will happen.</p>
