<p>I was pretty surprised and pleased when ToorCon finally released videos of the talks at <a href="http://toorcamp.org/">ToorCamp 2009</a>. At this years <a href="http://sandiego.toorcon.org/">ToorCon: San Diego</a> DVDs of the talks, pressed by <a href="http://www.mediaarchives.com/">MediaArchives</a>, were handed out. Thanks to <a href="http://deanpierce.net/">Mr. Pierce</a> for grabbing a copy of my talk on <a href="http://ronin.rubyforge.org/">Ronin</a> and getting it back to me for transcoding/uploading. The full talk has been transcoded to <a href="http://theora.org/">Ogg Theora</a> and uploaded to <a href="http://vimeo.com/">vimeo.com</a>. If you have a Vimeo account, you can download the original ogg file as well.</p>

<p>Original slides can be found <a href="http://ronin.rubyforge.org/talks/publishing_and_mayhem.html">here</a>, in XHTML form.</p>

<p>Thanks go out to <a href="http://github.com/cooperq/">flatline</a> and <a href="http://github.com/evoltech/">evoltech</a> for going with me to ToorCamp, providing transportation and helping hitch-hike back when our van broke down. Also extra thanks to evoltech for letting me use his SUV sized laptop to run the slides on.</p>
